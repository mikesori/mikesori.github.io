Title: Minima

Hi there! 

Welcome to the Folder and Files Breakdown document. Briefly, I will work through the backend structure of Minima that appears in your forked repository and highlight those folders and files that are relevant to the continued usage of your website. You will see many of these folders and files in a variety of Github spaces, including the "Keywords for the Caribbean" GitHub page that we will review later in this workshop.

The images above are screenshots of the Minima forked repository. If these images are not loading, that's okay! If you have forked the repository as per the instructions in the previous document, we should be looking at the same backend. 

Let's work through each of these folders:
- Folder - ".github/workflows"
	- This is supporting documentation from the original creator that you will not need to engage with to edit your website. It contains certain backend codes about the building and construction of demo sites. We will not be using this folder but also do not delete it!
- Folder - "Includes"
	- Again, this is another folder that you will not normally need to use. This contains html files that you can edit to change header and footer information on the website, as well as your social media contents that would appear at the bottom of your webpage. Again, you will not normally need to use this folder. 
- Folder - "layouts"
	- This folder will show you the basic structure of the Minima repository. It contains space for the Base code, the homepage, the layout for pages and for posts. Again, this is another folder that you will not need to normally use. Rather, these three folders give the basic structure, look, and feel of the Minima repository. 
- Folder - "posts"
	- Minima is a blog style repository but you will notice that the posts folder will appear in most repositories you work with on Github. The posts folder will be the primary folder that you use while working on your GitHub site. All written materials are posted to this folder in the repository. 
- Folder - "sass"
	- Code that handles the aesthetics, look, and feel of the site. Specifically handles CSS documents. 
- Folder - "assests"
	- Images uploaded on posts or included on your website can be locally stored into this folder. When you include an image in a post, it will "pull" the image from a locally stored file on your repository. Those images, sounds, etc. will live in this file. 
- Folder - "script"
	- Coding and script information. No need to touch this folder. 
- File - "editorconfig"
	- Handles spacing, indentation, and so forth. You will not need to engage with this as these premade repositories are built so that you do not need to worry about these more advanced config files. 
- File - "gitignore"
	- Advanced backend material. Should not need to use. 
- File - "404"
	- This is the error message that users will see when they attempt to go somewhere on your website that no longer exists. For an example of what this looks like, you can visit [michaelsoriano.net/404](michaelsoriano.net/404).
- File - "Code of Conduct"
	- Backend agreement material between users of forked pathways and the original creators. Not every repository will have one of these. 
- File - "Gemfile"
	- Advanced material. Will not need to use this file. 
- File - "History.markdown"
	- This is a file documenting Minima's update history. 
- File - "license.txt"
	- Minima copyright documentation. 
- File - "Readme"
	- Minima installation and set-up guide. 
- File - "config.yml"
	- If you imagine the HTML file we worked on earlier, this file changes all the elements that would be included in the "Head" nest. 
- File - "about"
	- You can update this file to create an "About" page on your site.
- File - "Index"
	- You will not need to engage with this file. 
- The remaining files, "minima.gemspec", "readme_banner", and "screenshot" will not be relevant for the continuation of this workshop.
